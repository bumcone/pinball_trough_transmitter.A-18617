## LED Alignment

When mounted to a trough ( such as `A-16809-2` ), this board has its LEDs
aligned in the center of the pill shaped openings. This seems to be more like
the alignment of the `A-17982-AI` / `A-17982` board
( `5768-13660-01` PCB ) found in other Williams machines. This seems like a
better spot to put them and for my purpose (homebrew), it does not matter as I
will align the other board accordingly. If however, you were to use these boards
with an existing `A-18618` / `A-18618-1` you'd probably want the LEDs to align
at the bottom, in which case you'd use the
[bottom aligned](https://github.com/bumcone/pinball_trough_transmitter.A-18617/tree/bottom)
version of this board.
